👋 Hi, I’m Roshan — a Junior Full-Stack Developer with hands-on experience building production-style web applications using TypeScript, React, Next.js, Node.js, and PostgreSQL.

I’ve worked on authentication-heavy systems, session management, and backend APIs, and I enjoy refactoring codebases to improve structure and maintainability.

📌 Currently focused on: backend logic, authentication flows, and scalable application architecture.
